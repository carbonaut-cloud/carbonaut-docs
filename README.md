## Guide

This guide covers the necessary bits. As the project evolves, it will only become more comprehensive


### Theme
We use as theme compose. If you find bugs or looking for new features, feel free to open a [PR](https://github.com/onweru/compose/pulls), raise an [issue](https://github.com/onweru/compose/issues/new/choose "Open a Github Issue")(s) or request new feature(s).

### Diagrams and charts
You can generate diagrams, flowcharts, and piecharts from text in a similar manner as markdown using [mermaid](./docs/compose/mermaid/).

Or, [generate graphs, charts](docs/compose/graphs-charts-tables/#show-a-pie-doughnut--bar-chart-at-once) and tables from a csv file.
